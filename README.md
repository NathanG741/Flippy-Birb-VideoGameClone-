### **About Flippy Birb**


This is a clone of the game Flappy Bird that came out in 2013 for mobile devices. The purpose of this clone is to give me a better understanding of Unity and how to work with C# to program physics and logic to my assets within the game. 

My MVP will simply replicate the features of the already existing game, you will start off within an empty space, gravity physics will effect your model forcing you to "flap" up via space bar to ensure you don't go off screen. Pipe objects will begin spawning randomly with openings for you to pass through. Position yourself properly to pass through the opening otherwise you lose upon contact between your model and the pipes. The objective is to survive for as long as possible without touching a pipe.

### **Future Plans**

As of right now I have no serious plans on adding more features to the game than what already exist within the game otherwise it won't be a replica, the purpose of this is purely educational. However, if the situation comes where I want to add features to make it unique and no longer a replica i'd like to consider the following features:

- Perhaps a way to change your model from not just a single bird but rather a variety (models i'll have to create myself in the future).
- A Main Menu rather than starting off immediately in game.
- More obstacles than just pipes.
- Some sort of difficulty multiplier that'll change the way you play the game.
- A way to track your scores.

### **Tech Stack**

Flippy Birb will operate on the Unity Engine, the programming will be done in C# and will also use ShaderLab for simple shading as well as HLSL.
