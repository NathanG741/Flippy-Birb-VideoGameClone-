### **About Flippy Birb**


This is a clone of the game Flappy Bird that came out in 2013 for mobile devices. The purpose of this clone is to give me a better understanding of Unity and how to work with C# to program physics and logic to my assets within the game. 

My MVP will simply replicate the features of the already existing game, you will start off within an empty space, gravity physics will effect your model forcing you to "flap" up via space bar to ensure you don't go off screen. Pipe objects will begin spawning randomly with openings for you to pass through. Position yourself properly to pass through the opening otherwise you lose upon contact between your model and the pipes. The objective is to survive for as long as possible without touching a pipe.
